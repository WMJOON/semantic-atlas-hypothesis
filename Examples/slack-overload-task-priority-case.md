# Slack overload: task priority meaning collapse

## 0) One-line summary

In high-message environments, “more updates” can reduce decision quality if the system lacks a chart that preserves priority and termination conditions.

## 1) Context

- Domain: organizational knowledge work
- Setting: Slack channels with parallel threads and rapid updates
- Decision: what to do next, what to ignore, what to escalate

## 2) What information existed

- Many messages, links, status notes, and partial decisions
- Some logical info (checklists, threads), but scattered

## 3) Meaning breakdown

- Cognitive budget is consumed by context switching
- Semantic entropy rises: many plausible “next actions”
- Missing termination condition: “this is the smallest set of facts needed to act”

## 4) Local charts involved

- Timeline chart: what happened recently
- Priority chart: what matters now (impact × urgency × reversibility)
- Mismatch: timeline dominates; priority chart is not explicitly enforced

## 5) Semantic Atlas reframing

- Maintain a priority-preserving chart (explicit rubrics + stable “now/next/later” buckets)
- Summaries should be judged by *actionability*, not by coverage

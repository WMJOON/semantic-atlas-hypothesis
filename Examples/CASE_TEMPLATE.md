# Case study template

## 0) One-line summary

*(What happened, in one sentence?)*  

## 1) Context

- Domain:
- System setting (LLM/agent/robot/etc):
- Stakeholders:
- Decision that had to be made:

## 2) What information existed (and why it was not enough)

- Available signals / documents / outputs:
- “Logical information” produced (if any):
- Where overload happened:

## 3) Meaning breakdown (what failed)

- What judgment was deferred or mistaken?
- What interpretation branches exploded (semantic entropy)?
- What termination condition was missing?

## 4) Local charts involved

- Chart A (e.g., numeric / rule-based / narrative / embodied):
- Chart B:
- Chart mismatch (if any):

## 5) What a Semantic Atlas approach would change

- What chart should be selected first (and why)?
- What compression/expansion should happen?
- What “decision packet” would be sufficient for a human?

## 6) Agent decision points (if applicable)

- When should the agent stop and ask?
- What minimum evidence should the agent present?
- What should remain automated (no semantic escalation)?

## 7) Open questions

- What would falsify this interpretation?
- What measurement could be added (if any)?
